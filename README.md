## Overview
This repository implements a 3D super-resolution network that incorporates wavelet transforms, deformable convolutions, and perceptual loss functions for video super-resolution tasks. Without the use of a heavy transformer, we are able to achieve decent super-resolution performance 

## Training
Run the training script with:

```bash
python train.py
```
